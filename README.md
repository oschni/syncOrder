Happy cloning and forking!

## What you get

A simple express-app with bootstrap frontend to coordinate ordering in your office. The text is hard coded in german and there is the menu card of our weekly pizza delivery.

You are welcome to customize for your needs :)

The textfields and table are updated in realtime via websockets - thank you [socket.io](https://socket.io/)!
